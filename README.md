ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stash
- I like cryptography, mechanical keyboards, and lots of other stuff.
- My pronouns are they/them, or NULL/NIL (which means just don't use pronouns and use my name, unless that gets awkward)
- No, you can't buy this username.
- You can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://infosec.exchange/@stash">https://infosec.exchange/@stash</a>
- I used to be at https://twitter.com/jstash
